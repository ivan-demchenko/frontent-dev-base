# Front-end Grunt-Bower Boilerplate

This is a test project, that was initially intended to explain how to start with Grunt and Bower.

But I also use it for my purposes.

## Usage

* CoffeeScript
* Stylus
* Jade
* Karma
* Jasmine

## Quick start

In your console run
`cd you_project_path`
`git clone git@github.com:raqystyle/frontent-dev-base.git .`
`./install.sh`

## File structure

```
